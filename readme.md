# Divera iCalendar API Integration

Welcome! This application allows you to import the calendar from the Divera app as a `.ics` file, making it easy to integrate Divera events with your calendar applications.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## üìç Current Route for Calendar Integration

You can access the Divera calendar as an `.ics` file at:
```
http://SERVERIP:1312/DiveraCalendar.ics
```
=======
Directly linking to an .ics file is essential for automated calendar updates because most calendar apps, like Google Calendar, rely on a URL to continuously refresh event data. When the file is downloadable only, this automation breaks, requiring manual downloads and imports to reflect new changes. By providing a persistent URL to an .ics file, calendar apps can periodically access this link, keeping the calendar in sync without user intervention, which is crucial for live updates.
